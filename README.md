# LLM-Agents for Simulation

## :house: Introduction

In the realm of understanding complex systems, simulation serves as a fundamental tool for unraveling intricate dynamics. With the emergence of LLM-powered agents, we are witnessing a profound transformation in simulation methodologies.

Our mission with this repository is to curate an extensive collection of resources that showcase the intersection of simulation and LLM-agents. From papers to repositories and beyond, we aim to provide a comprehensive hub for researchers, enthusiasts, and practitioners interested in leveraging LLM technology for simulating complex phenomena.
